Using Power BI, this project offers a thorough examination of retail sales data. Important variables including total revenue, sales trends, top-performing products, and client segmentation are all visualized in this process. Identification of sales trends, regional performance, and expansion prospects are facilitated by the analysis. This initiative provides analytical reports and interactive dashboards that facilitate data-driven decision-making in retail management.
